Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n <= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds > maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (< 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: < 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: < 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: < 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (< 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-30T03:02:47.954306Z","updated_at":"2025-10-31T00:12:58.182217Z","closed_at":"2025-10-29T03:47:28.317007Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

Tests Are Not Properly Categorized\nWe have three types of tests mixed together:\n- **Unit tests** - should be fast, test single functions\n- **Integration tests** - test full workflows, need DB/git\n- **End-to-end tests** - test entire CLI commands\n\nThey're all lumped together in cmd/bd, all running every time.\n\n# What We've Already Fixed\n\nAdded `integration` build tags to 16 obviously-slow test files:\n- import_profile_test.go (performance benchmarking tests)\n- export_mtime_test.go (tests with time.Sleep calls)\n- cli_fast_test.go (full CLI integration tests)\n- delete_test.go, import_uncommitted_test.go, sync_local_only_test.go (git integration)\n- And 10 more in internal/ packages\n\nThese are now excluded from the default `go test ./...` run.\n\n# Proposed Solutions\n\n## Option 1: Shared Test Fixtures (Quick Win)\nCreate a shared test database that multiple tests can use:\n```go\nvar testDB *sqlite.SQLiteStorage\nvar testDBOnce sync.Once\n\nfunc getSharedTestDB(t *testing.T) storage.Storage {\n    testDBOnce.Do(func() {\n        // Create one DB for all tests\n    })\n    return testDB\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Easy to implement, immediate speedup\n**Cons**: Tests become less isolated, harder to debug failures\n\n## Option 2: Table-Driven Tests (Medium Win)\nCollapse similar tests into table-driven tests:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate(t *testing.T) {\n    tests := []struct{\n        name string\n        args []string\n        want string\n    }{\n        {\"basic issue\", []string{\"create\", \"Test\"}, \"created\"},\n        {\"with description\", []string{\"create\", \"Test\", \"-d\", \"desc\"}, \"created\"},\n        // ... 50 more cases\n    }\n    \n    db := setupOnce(t) // Setup once, not 50 times\n    for _, tt := range tests {\n        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n            // test using shared db\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Dramatically reduces setup overhead, tests run in parallel\n**Cons**: Requires refactoring, tests share more state\n\n## Option 3: Split cmd/bd Tests Into Packages (Big Win)\nMove tests into focused packages:\n- `cmd/bd/internal/clitests` - CLI integration tests (mark with integration tag)\n- `cmd/bd/internal/unittests` - Fast unit tests\n- Keep only essential tests in cmd/bd\n\n**Pros**: Clean separation, easy to run just fast tests\n**Cons**: Requires significant refactoring\n\n## Option 4: Parallel Execution (Quick Win)\nAdd `t.Parallel()` to independent tests:\n```go\nfunc TestSomething(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel() // Run this test concurrently with others\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Easy to add, can cut time in half on multi-core machines\n**Cons**: Doesn't reduce actual test work, just parallelizes it\n\n## Option 5: In-Memory Databases (Medium Win)\nUse `:memory:` SQLite databases instead of file-based:\n```go\nstore, err := sqlite.New(ctx, \":memory:\")\n```\n\n**Pros**: Faster than disk I/O, easier cleanup\n**Cons**: Some tests need actual file-based DBs (export/import tests)\n\n# Recommended Approach\n\n**Short-term (this week)**:\n1. Add `t.Parallel()` to all independent tests in cmd/bd\n2. Use `:memory:` databases where possible\n3. Create table-driven tests for similar test cases\n\n**Medium-term (next sprint)**:\n4. Split cmd/bd tests into focused packages\n5. Mark more integration tests appropriately\n\n**Long-term (backlog)**:\n6. Consider shared test fixtures with proper isolation\n\n# Current Status\n\nWe've tagged 16 files with `integration` build tag, but the remaining 279 tests in cmd/bd still take 8+ minutes. This issue tracks fixing the cmd/bd test performance specifically.\n\n# Target\n\nGet `go test ./...` (without `-short` or `-tags=integration`) down to **under 30 seconds**.\n\n\n# THE REAL ROOT CAUSE (Updated Analysis)\n\nAfter examining the actual test code, the problem is clear:\n\n## Every Test Creates Its Own Database From Scratch\n\nLook at `create_test.go`:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate_BasicIssue(t *testing.T) {\n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()                          // ← Creates temp dir\n    testDB := filepath.Join(tmpDir, \".beads\", \"beads.db\")\n    s := newTestStore(t, testDB)                   // ← Opens NEW SQLite connection\n                                                    // ← Runs migrations\n                                                    // ← Sets config\n    // ... actual test (3 lines)\n}\n\nfunc TestCreate_WithDescription(t *testing.T) {\n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()                          // ← Creates ANOTHER temp dir\n    testDB := filepath.Join(tmpDir, \".beads\", \"beads.db\")\n    s := newTestStore(t, testDB)                   // ← Opens ANOTHER SQLite connection\n    // ... actual test (3 lines)\n}\n```\n\n**This happens 279 times!**\n\n## These Tests Don't Need Isolation!\n\nMost tests are just checking:\n- \"Can I create an issue with a title?\"\n- \"Can I create an issue with a description?\"\n- \"Can I add labels?\"\n\nThey don't conflict with each other. They could all share ONE database!\n\n## The Fix: Test Suites with Shared Setup\n\nInstead of:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate_BasicIssue(t *testing.T) {\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")  // ← Expensive!\n    // test\n}\n\nfunc TestCreate_WithDesc(t *testing.T) {\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")  // ← Expensive!\n    // test\n}\n```\n\nDo this:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate(t *testing.T) {\n    // ONE setup for all subtests\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")\n    \n    t.Run(\"basic_issue\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        t.Parallel()  // Can run concurrently - tests don't conflict\n        // test using shared `s`\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"with_description\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        t.Parallel()\n        // test using shared `s`\n    })\n    \n    // ... 50 more subtests, all using same DB\n}\n```\n\n**Result**: 50 tests → 1 database setup instead of 50!\n\n## Why This Works\n\nSQLite is fine with concurrent reads and isolated transactions. These tests:\n- ✅ Create different issues (no ID conflicts)\n- ✅ Just read back what they created\n- ✅ Don't depend on database state from other tests\n\nThey SHOULD share a database!\n\n## Real Numbers\n\nCurrent:\n- 279 tests × (create dir + init SQLite + migrations) = **8 minutes**\n\nAfter fix:\n- 10 test suites × (create dir + init SQLite + migrations) = **30 seconds**\n- 279 subtests running in parallel using those 10 DBs = **5 seconds**\n\n**Total: ~35 seconds instead of 8 minutes!**\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Group related tests** into suites (Create, List, Update, Delete, etc.)\n2. **One setup per suite** instead of per test\n3. **Use t.Run() for subtests** with t.Parallel()\n4. **Keep tests that actually need isolation** separate (export/import tests, git operations)\n\nThis is way better than shuffling tests into folders!","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-21T16:37:47.886207Z","updated_at":"2025-11-22T19:57:44.480203204Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":"","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-1rh","depends_on_id":"bd-c49","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-21T16:49:26.347518Z","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"bd-22e0bde9","title":"Add TestNWayCollision for 5+ clones","description":"## Overview\nAdd comprehensive tests for N-way (5+) collision resolution to verify the solution scales beyond 3 clones.\n\n## Purpose\nWhile TestThreeCloneCollision validates the basic N-way case, we need to verify:\n1. Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i < numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i < numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n <= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds > maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (< 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: < 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: < 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: < 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-cbed9619.2 to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (< 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-30T06:05:13.974702Z","updated_at":"2025-10-31T19:00:43.197709Z","closed_at":"2025-10-31T19:00:43.197709Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

TestThreeCloneCollision demonstrates this with reproducible failures.\n\n## Root Causes Identified\n1. Pairwise resolution doesn't scale - each clone makes local decisions without global context\n2. DetectCollisions modifies state during detection (line 83-86 in collision.go)\n3. No remapping history - can't track transitive remap chains (test-1 → test-2 → test-3)\n4. Import-time resolution is too late - happens after git merge\n\n## Solution Architecture\nReplace pairwise resolution with deterministic global N-way resolution using:\n- Content-addressable identity (content hashing)\n- Global collision resolution (sort all versions by hash)\n- Read-only detection phase (separate from modification)\n- Idempotent imports (content-first matching)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes without skipping\n- All clones converge to identical content after final pull\n- No data loss (all issues present in all clones)\n- Works for N workers (test with 5+ clones)\n- Idempotent imports (importing same JSONL multiple times is safe)\n\n## Implementation Phases\nSee child issues for detailed breakdown of each phase.","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-30T06:05:13.889079Z","updated_at":"2025-10-31T18:59:41.031668Z","closed_at":"2025-10-31T18:59:41.031668Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

Create a new issue: bd create --title='Test issue'\n2. Run bd sync\n3. Observe: New issue appears in sanitize removal list\n4. Issue is removed from local JSONL but preserved on beads-sync branch\n\n## Observed Behavior\n\nDuring sync, the sanitize step outputs:\n```\n→ Sanitized JSONL: removed 738 deleted issue(s) that were resurrected by git merge\n  - bd-08ea  (newly created issue!)\n  - bd-tnsq  (newly created issue!)\n  ...\n```\n\nThe newly created issues get removed locally but remain on beads-sync branch.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nNewly created issues should NOT be removed by sanitize. The sanitize should only remove issues that:\n1. Were previously deleted (have tombstones or are in deletions manifest)\n2. Are being resurrected from old git history\n\n## Root Cause Investigation\n\nThe sanitize logic likely compares the local DB snapshot against some reference and incorrectly classifies new issues as 'resurrected deleted issues'. Possible causes:\n- Snapshot protection logic not accounting for new issues\n- Deletion manifest containing stale entries\n- Race condition between export and sanitize\n\n## Impact\n\n- New issues disappear from local JSONL after sync\n- Issues remain on beads-sync but cause confusion\n- Multi-agent workflows affected when agents can't see new issues locally\n- Requires manual intervention to recover\n\n## Files to Investigate\n\n- cmd/bd/sync.go - sanitize logic\n- cmd/bd/snapshot_manager.go - snapshot comparison\n- Deletion manifest handling\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Newly created issues survive sync without being sanitized\n- [ ] Only truly deleted/resurrected issues are removed\n- [ ] Add test case for this scenario","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-14T08:45:26.828547Z","updated_at":"2025-12-16T09:06:10.358958Z","closed_at":"2025-12-14T08:54:44.772671Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n <= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds > maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (< 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: < 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: < 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: < 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-dcd6f14b to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (< 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-30T02:52:05.462747Z","updated_at":"2025-10-31T19:00:43.198413Z","closed_at":"2025-10-31T19:00:43.198413Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

{"id":"bd-5dae5504","title":"Export deduplication breaks when JSONL and export_hashes table diverge","description":"## Problem\n\nThe export deduplication feature (timestamp-only skipping) breaks when the JSONL file and export_hashes table get out of sync, causing exports to skip issues that aren't actually in the file.\n\n## Symptoms\n\n- `bd export` reports \"Skipped 128 issue(s) with timestamp-only changes\"\n- JSONL file only has 38 lines but DB has 149 issues\n- export_hashes table has 149 entries\n- Auto-import doesn't trigger (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Two repos on same commit show different issue counts\n\n## Root Cause\n\nshouldSkipExport() in autoflush.go compares current issue hash with stored export_hashes entry. If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-30T06:05:13.959435Z","updated_at":"2025-10-31T00:12:58.207148Z","closed_at":"2025-10-30T04:57:03.066410Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

{"id":"bd-627d","title":"AI-supervised database migrations for safer schema evolution","description":"## Problem\n\nDatabase migrations can lose user data through edge cases that are hard to anticipate (e.g., GH #201 where bd migrate failed to set issue_prefix, or bd-d355a07d false positive data loss warnings). Since beads is designed to be run by AI agents, we should leverage AI to make migrations safer.\n\n## Current State\n\nMigrations run blindly with:\n- No pre-flight validation\n- No data integrity verification\n- No rollback on failure\n- Limited post-migration testing\n\nRecent issues:\n- GH #201: Migration didn't set issue_prefix config, breaking commands\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive \"data loss\" warnings on collision resolution\n- Users reported migration data loss (fixed but broader problem remains)\n\n## Proposal: AI-Supervised Migration Framework\n\nUse AI to supervise migrations through structured verification:\n\n### 1. Pre-Migration Analysis\n- AI reads migration code and current schema\n- Identifies potential data loss scenarios\n- Generates validation queries to verify assumptions\n- Creates snapshot queries for before/after comparison\n\n### 2. Migration Execution\n- Take database backup/snapshot\n- Run validation queries (pre-state)\n- Execute migration in transaction\n- Run validation queries (post-state)\n\n### 3. Post-Migration Verification\n- AI compares pre/post snapshots\n- Verifies data integrity invariants\n- Checks for unexpected data loss\n- Validates config completeness (like issue_prefix)\n\n### 4. Rollback on Anomalies\n- If AI detects data loss, rollback transaction\n- Present human-readable error report\n- Suggest fix before retrying\n\n## Example Flow\n\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified 3 potential data loss scenarios\n→ Generating validation queries...\n→ Creating pre-migration snapshot...\n→ Running migration in transaction...\n→ Verifying post-migration state...\n✓ All 247 issues accounted for\n✓ Config table complete (issue_prefix: \"mcp\")\n✓ Dependencies intact (342 relationships verified)\n→ Migration successful!\n```\n\nIf something goes wrong:\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified issue: Missing issue_prefix config after migration\n→ Recommendation: Add prefix detection step\n→ Aborting migration - database unchanged\n```\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n\n### A. Migration Validator Tool\nCreate `bd migrate --validate` that:\n- Simulates migration on copy of database\n- Uses AI to verify data integrity\n- Reports potential issues before real migration\n\n### B. Migration Test Generator\nAI generates test cases for migrations:\n- Edge cases (empty DB, large DB, missing config)\n- Data integrity checks\n- Regression tests\n\n### C. Migration Invariants\nDefine invariants that AI checks:\n- Issue count should not decrease (unless collision resolution)\n- All required config keys present\n- Foreign key relationships intact\n- No orphaned dependencies\n\n### D. Self-Healing Migrations\nAI detects incomplete migrations and suggests fixes:\n- Missing config values (like GH #201)\n- Orphaned data\n- Index inconsistencies\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Catch edge cases**: AI explores scenarios humans miss\n2. **Self-documenting**: AI explains what migration does\n3. **Agent-friendly**: Agents can run migrations confidently\n4. **Fewer rollbacks**: Detect issues before committing\n5. **Better testing**: AI generates comprehensive test suites\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Which AI model? (Fast: Haiku, Thorough: Sonnet/GPT-4)\n2. How to balance safety vs migration speed?\n3. Should AI validation be required or optional?\n4. How to handle offline scenarios (no API access)?\n5. What invariants should always be checked?\n\n## Related Work\n\n- bd-b245: Migration registry (makes migrations introspectable)\n- GH #201: issue_prefix migration bug (motivating example)\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive data loss warnings","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-02T20:57:10.722048Z","updated_at":"2025-12-14T20:12:46.522298Z","closed_at":"2025-11-02T22:31:25.095308Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

{"id":"bd-70419816","title":"Export deduplication breaks when JSONL and export_hashes table diverge","description":"## Problem\n\nThe export deduplication feature (timestamp-only skipping) breaks when the JSONL file and export_hashes table get out of sync, causing exports to skip issues that aren't actually in the file.\n\n## Symptoms\n\n- `bd export` reports \"Skipped 128 issue(s) with timestamp-only changes\"\n- JSONL file only has 38 lines but DB has 149 issues\n- export_hashes table has 149 entries\n- Auto-import doesn't trigger (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Two repos on same commit show different issue counts\n\n## Root Cause\n\nshouldSkipExport() in autoflush.go compares current issue hash with stored export_hashes entry. If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-30T06:05:13.960352Z","updated_at":"2025-10-31T00:12:58.196790Z","closed_at":"2025-10-30T05:22:20.406934Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

{"id":"bd-7a2b58fc","title":"Implement clone-scoped ID allocation to prevent N-way collisions","description":"## Problem\nCurrent ID allocation uses per-clone atomic counters (issue_counters table) that sync based on local database state. In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-0dcea000 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-30T03:02:47.952447Z","updated_at":"2025-12-14T20:12:46.506819Z","closed_at":"2025-11-07T03:27:29.416290Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

Daemon enters bad state - 'bd show' and other commands return EOF\n5. 'bd list' still works, daemon process is running, no errors logged\n\nTechnical details:\n- Auto-import check runs in handleRequest() before processing RPC commands\n- When import is blocked, it appears to corrupt daemon state\n- Likely: deadlock, unclosed transaction, or storage handle corruption\n- Panic recovery (server_lifecycle_conn.go:183) didn't catch anything - not a panic\n\nRequired fix:\n- Auto-import must not block RPC command execution\n- Handle git pull failures gracefully without corrupting state\n- Consider: skip auto-import if git is dirty, queue import for later, or use separate goroutine\n- Add timeout/circuit breaker for import operations\n- Log clear warnings when auto-import is skipped\n\nWithout this fix, users in collaborative environments will frequently encounter mysterious EOF errors that require daemon restarts.","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-03T01:15:25.181425Z","updated_at":"2025-12-14T20:12:46.564936Z","closed_at":"2025-11-03T20:08:12.949064Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":"","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-8931","depends_on_id":"bd-1048","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-03T01:15:25.181857Z","created_by":"stevey"}]}

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research & Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration & Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a, bd-6221bdcd","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-30T03:48:00.267736Z","updated_at":"2025-11-01T03:06:44.605360Z","closed_at":"2025-11-01T03:06:44.605360Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

{"id":"bd-9ae788be","title":"Implement clone-scoped ID allocation to prevent N-way collisions","description":"## Problem\nCurrent ID allocation uses per-clone atomic counters (issue_counters table) that sync based on local database state. In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-e6d71828 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T17:22:52.260524Z","updated_at":"2025-12-14T20:12:46.561129Z","closed_at":"2025-11-08T08:36:58.134558Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

They're:\n- Automatically assigned on issue creation\n- Reassigned deterministically on sync (if conflicts)\n- Can be manually controlled with `bd alias` commands\n```\n\n### 2. AGENTS.md\nUpdate agent workflow:\n```markdown\n## Hash-Based IDs (v2.0+)\n\nBeads v2.0 uses hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems:\n\n**When creating issues**:\n```bash\nbd create \"Fix bug\" -p 1\n# → Creates bd-af78e9a2 with alias #1\n```\n\n**When referencing issues**:\n- In text: Use hash IDs (stable): \"See bd-af78e9a2 for details\"\n- In CLI: Use aliases (readable): `bd update #42 --status done`\n\n**After sync**:\n- Alias conflicts resolved automatically (content-hash ordering)\n- No ID collisions possible\n- No remapping needed\n\n**Migration from v1.x**:\n```bash\nbd migrate --hash-ids  # One-time migration\n```\n```\n\n### 3.

Detects on insert (UNIQUE constraint)\n2. Appends random suffix: `bd-af78e9a2-a1b2`\n3. Retries insert\n\n## Alias Conflict Resolution\n\nWhen multiple clones assign same alias to different issues:\n\n**Strategy**: Content-hash ordering (deterministic)\n- Sort conflicting issue IDs lexicographically\n- Lowest hash ID keeps the alias\n- Others reassigned to next available aliases\n\n**Example**:\n```\nClone A: Assigns #42 to bd-a1b2c3d4\nClone B: Assigns #42 to bd-e5f6a7b8\nAfter sync: bd-a1b2c3d4 keeps #42 (lower hash)\n            bd-e5f6a7b8 gets #100 (next available)\n```\n```\n\n### 5.

Run Migration\n```bash\n# Dry run first\nbd migrate --hash-ids --dry-run\n\n# Apply migration\nbd migrate --hash-ids\n```\n\n### 3. Commit Changes\n```bash\ngit add .beads/issues.jsonl\ngit commit -m \"Migrate to hash-based IDs (v2.0)\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 4. Coordinate with Collaborators\nAll clones must migrate before syncing:\n1. Notify team: \"Migrating to v2.0 on [date]\"\n2. All collaborators pull latest\n3. All run `bd migrate --hash-ids`\n4. All push changes\n5. Resume normal work\n\n## Rollback\n```bash\n# Restore backup\nmv .beads.backup .beads\nbd export  # Regenerate JSONL\ngit checkout .beads/issues.jsonl\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Can I mix v1.x and v2.0 clones?**\nA: No. All clones must be on same version.\n\n**Q: Will my old issue IDs work?**\nA: No, but aliases preserve the numbers: bd-1c63eb84 → #1\n\n**Q: What happens to links like \"see bd-cb64c226.3\"?**\nA: Migration updates all text references automatically.\n```\n\n### 6.

{"id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","title":"Update MCP server for hash IDs","description":"Update beads-mcp server to support hash IDs and aliases.\n\n## Changes Needed\n\n### 1. MCP Function Signatures (No Change)\nFunctions already use issue IDs as strings, so they work with hash IDs:\n\n```python\n# These already work!\nbeads_show(issue_id: str)           # Accepts bd-af78e9a2 or #42\nbeads_update(issue_id: str, ...)    # Accepts both formats\nbeads_close(issue_ids: List[str])   # Accepts both formats\n```\n\n### 2. Add Alias Resolution Helper\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py\n\n```python\ndef resolve_issue_id(issue_id: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Resolve alias to hash ID if needed.\"\"\"\n    # Hash ID: pass through\n    if issue_id.startswith('bd-') and len(issue_id) == 11:\n        return issue_id\n    \n    # Alias: #42 or 42\n    alias_str = issue_id.lstrip('#')\n    try:\n        alias = int(alias_str)\n        # Call bd to resolve\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            ['bd', 'alias', 'find', f'bd-{alias}'],\n            capture_output=True, text=True\n        )\n        if result.returncode == 0:\n            return result.stdout.strip()\n    except ValueError:\n        pass\n    \n    # Invalid format\n    raise ValueError(f\"Invalid issue ID: {issue_id}\")\n```\n\n### 3. Update Response Formatting\nShow aliases in responses:\n\n```python\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_show(issue_id: str) -> List[TextContent]:\n    resolved_id = resolve_issue_id(issue_id)\n    \n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'show', resolved_id], ...)\n    \n    # Parse response and add alias info\n    # Format: \"bd-af78e9a2 (alias: #42)\"\n    ...\n```\n\n### 4. Add beads_alias_* Functions\n\n```python\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_list() -> List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"List all alias mappings.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'list'], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_set(alias: int, issue_id: str) -> List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"Manually assign alias to issue.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'set', str(alias), issue_id], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_compact() -> List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"Compact aliases to fill gaps.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'compact'], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n```\n\n### 5. Update Documentation\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/README.md\n\n```markdown\n## Issue IDs (v2.0+)\n\nThe MCP server accepts both hash IDs and aliases:\n\n```python\n# Using hash IDs\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"bd-af78e9a2\")\n\n# Using aliases\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"#42\")\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"42\")  # Shorthand\n```\n\n## Alias Management\n\nNew functions for alias control:\n\n- `beads_alias_list()` - List all alias mappings\n- `beads_alias_set(alias, issue_id)` - Manually assign alias\n- `beads_alias_compact()` - Compact aliases to fill gaps\n\n## Migration\n\nAfter migrating to hash IDs:\n1. Update beads-mcp: `pip install --upgrade beads-mcp`\n2. Restart MCP server\n3. All existing workflows continue to work\n```\n\n### 6. Version Compatibility\nDetect and handle both v1.x and v2.0 formats:\n\n```python\ndef detect_beads_version() -> str:\n    \"\"\"Detect if beads is using sequential or hash IDs.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'list', '-n', '1'], ...)\n    first_id = parse_first_issue_id(result.stdout)\n    \n    if first_id.startswith('bd-') and len(first_id) > 11:\n        return '2.0'  # Hash ID\n    else:\n        return '1.x'  # Sequential ID\n\n# On startup\nbeads_version = detect_beads_version()\nlogger.info(f\"Detected beads version: {beads_version}\")\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n### Unit Tests\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/tests/test_hash_ids.py\n\n```python\ndef test_resolve_hash_id():\n    \"\"\"Hash IDs pass through unchanged.\"\"\"\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"bd-af78e9a2\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n\ndef test_resolve_alias():\n    \"\"\"Aliases resolve to hash IDs.\"\"\"\n    # Mock bd alias find command\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"#42\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"42\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n\ndef test_invalid_id():\n    \"\"\"Invalid IDs raise ValueError.\"\"\"\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n        resolve_issue_id(\"invalid\")\n```\n\n### Integration Tests\n```python\nasync def test_show_with_hash_id(mcp_server):\n    result = await mcp_server.beads_show(issue_id=\"bd-af78e9a2\")\n    assert \"bd-af78e9a2\" in result[0].text\n\nasync def test_show_with_alias(mcp_server):\n    result = await mcp_server.beads_show(issue_id=\"#42\")\n    assert \"bd-af78e9a2\" in result[0].text  # Resolved\n```\n\n## Backward Compatibility\nThe MCP server should work with both:\n- Beads v1.x (sequential IDs)\n- Beads v2.0+ (hash IDs)\n\nDetection happens at runtime based on issue ID format.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py\n- integrations/beads-mcp/README.md\n- integrations/beads-mcp/tests/test_hash_ids.py (new)\n- integrations/beads-mcp/pyproject.toml (bump version)\n\n## Deployment\n```bash\ncd integrations/beads-mcp\n# Bump version to 2.0.0\npoetry version 2.0.0\n# Publish to PyPI\npoetry publish --build\n```","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-30T04:28:45.256074Z","updated_at":"2025-10-31T19:32:32.607860Z","closed_at":"2025-10-31T19:32:32.607860Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":"","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-30T04:28:45.257315Z","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-30T04:28:45.258057Z","created_by":"stevey"}]}

Add new flags to `bd create`\n\n```go\ncreateCmd.Flags().String(\"body-file\", \"\", \"Read description from file (use - for stdin)\")\ncreateCmd.Flags().String(\"description-file\", \"\", \"Alias for --body-file\")\n```\n\n### 2.

{"id":"bd-iq7n","title":"Audit and fix JSONL filename mismatches across all repo clones","description":"## Problem\n\nMultiple clones of repos are configured with different JSONL filenames (issues.jsonl vs beads.jsonl), causing:\n1. JSONL files to be resurrected after deletion (one clone pushes issues.jsonl, another pushes beads.jsonl)\n2. Agents unable to see issues filed by other agents after sync\n3. Merge conflicts and data inconsistencies\n\n## Root Cause\n\nWhen repos were \"bd doctored\" or initialized at different times, some got issues.jsonl (old default) and others got beads.jsonl (Beads repo specific). These clones push their respective files, creating duplicates.\n\n## Task\n\nScan all repo clones under ~/src/ (1-2 levels deep) and standardize their JSONL configuration.\n\n### Step 1: Find all beads-enabled repos\n\n```bash\n# Find all directories named 'beads' at levels 1-2 under ~/src/\nfind ~/src -maxdepth 2 -type d -name beads\n```\n\n### Step 2: For each repo found, check configuration\n\nFor each directory from Step 1, check:\n- Does `.beads/metadata.json` exist?\n- What is the `jsonl_export` value?\n- What JSONL files actually exist in `.beads/`?\n- Are there multiple JSONL files (problem!)?\n\n### Step 3: Create audit report\n\nGenerate a report showing:\n```\nRepo Path                           | Config        | Actual Files           | Status\n----------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------\n~/src/beads                         | beads.jsonl   | beads.jsonl            | OK\n~/src/dave/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl           | MISMATCH\n~/src/emma/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl, beads.jsonl | DUPLICATE!\n```\n\n### Step 4: Determine canonical name for each repo\n\nFor repos that are the SAME git repository (check `git remote -v`):\n- Group them together\n- Determine which JSONL filename should be canonical (majority wins, or beads.jsonl for the beads repo itself)\n- List which clones need to be updated\n\n### Step 5: Generate fix script\n\nCreate a script that for each mismatched clone:\n1. Updates `.beads/metadata.json` to use the canonical name\n2. If JSONL file needs renaming: `git mv .beads/old.jsonl .beads/new.jsonl`\n3. Removes any duplicate JSONL files: `git rm .beads/duplicate.jsonl`\n4. Commits the change\n5. Syncs: `bd sync`\n\n### Expected Output\n\n1. Audit report showing all repos and their config status\n2. List of repos grouped by git remote (same repository)\n3. Fix script or manual instructions for standardizing each repo\n4. Verification that after fixes, all clones of the same repo use the same JSONL filename\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Handle repos without metadata.json (use default discovery)\n- Handle repos with no git remote (standalone/local)\n- Handle repos that are not git repositories\n- Don't modify repos with uncommitted changes (warn instead)\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- All clones of the same git repository use the same JSONL filename\n- No duplicate JSONL files in any repo\n- All configurations documented in metadata.json\n- bd doctor passes on all repos","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-22T07:58:35.044762Z","updated_at":"2025-11-22T07:58:35.044762Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

When there's a repo ID mismatch (e.g., database from a different clone or after remote URL change), this can incorrectly treat local issues as deleted because they don't exist in the remote's git history.\n\n**Fix Applied:** Added safety guard at lines 971-987 in importer.go that:\n- Checks issue status before deletion via git-history-backfill\n- Prevents deletion of open/in_progress issues\n- Provides clear warning with actionable steps\n- Suggests using --no-git-history flag or bd delete for explicit deletion\n\n## Root Cause 2: Daemon sync race condition overwrites local unpushed changes\n\n**Location:** cmd/bd/daemon_sync.go, performAutoImport()\n\nThe daemon sync's auto-import function pulls from remote without checking for uncommitted local changes.

{"id":"bd-khnb","title":"bd migrate --update-repo-id triggers auto-import that resurrects deleted issues","description":"**Bug:** Running `bd migrate --update-repo-id` can resurrect previously deleted issues from git history.\n\n## What Happened\n\nUser deleted 490 closed issues:\n- Deletion committed successfully (06d655a) with JSONL at 48 lines\n- Database had 48 issues after deletion\n- User ran `bd migrate --update-repo-id` to fix legacy database\n- Migration triggered daemon auto-import\n- JSONL had been restored to 538 issues (from commit 6cd3a32 - before deletion)\n- Auto-import loaded the old JSONL over the cleaned database\n- Result: 490 deleted issues resurrected\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe auto-import logic in `cmd/bd/sync.go:130-136`:\n```go\nif isJSONLNewer(jsonlPath) {\n    fmt.Println(\"→ JSONL is newer than database, importing first...\")\n    if err := importFromJSONL(ctx, jsonlPath, renameOnImport); err != nil {\n```\n\nThis checks if JSONL mtime is newer than database and auto-imports. The problem:\n1. Git operations (pull, merge, checkout) can restore old JSONL files\n2. Restored file has recent mtime (time of git operation)\n3. Auto-import sees \"newer\" JSONL and imports it\n4. Old data overwrites current database state\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 19:59: Commit 6cd3a32 restored JSONL to 538 issues from d99222d\n- 20:22: Commit 3520321 (bd sync)\n- 20:23: Commit 06d655a deleted 490 issues → JSONL now 48 lines\n- 20:23: User ran `bd migrate --update-repo-id`\n- Migration completed, daemon started\n- Daemon saw JSONL (restored earlier to 538) was \"newer\" than database\n- Auto-import resurrected 490 deleted issues\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss bug** - user deletions can be undone silently\n- Affects any workflow that uses git branches, merges, or checkouts\n- Auto-import has no safety checks against importing older data\n- Users have no warning that old data will overwrite current state\n\n## Fix Options\n\n1. **Content-based staleness** (not mtime-based)\n   - Compare JSONL content hash vs database content hash\n   - Only import if content actually changed\n   - Prevents re-importing old data with new mtime\n\n2. **Database timestamp check**\n   - Store \"last export timestamp\" in database metadata\n   - Only import JSONL if it's newer than last export\n   - Prevents importing old JSONL after git operations\n\n3. **User confirmation**\n   - Before auto-import, show diff of what will change\n   - Require confirmation for large changes (>10% issues affected)\n   - Safety valve for destructive imports\n\n4. **Explicit sync mode**\n   - Disable auto-import entirely\n   - Require explicit `bd sync` or `bd import` commands\n   - Trade convenience for safety\n\n## Recommended Solution\n\nCombination of #1 and #2:\n- Add `last_export_timestamp` to database metadata\n- Check JSONL mtime > last_export_timestamp before importing\n- Add content hash check as additional safety\n- Show warning if importing would delete >10 issues\n\nThis preserves auto-import convenience while preventing data loss.\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- `cmd/bd/sync.go:130-136` - Auto-import logic\n- `cmd/bd/daemon_sync.go` - Daemon export/import cycle\n- `internal/autoimport/autoimport.go` - Staleness detection\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create and delete some issues, commit to git\n2. Checkout an earlier commit (before deletion)\n3. Checkout back to current commit\n4. JSONL file now has recent mtime but old content\n5. Run any bd command that triggers auto-import\n6.

If base had closed, local changed to tombstone, and remote has closed, git might keep remote's version.\n\nThe early tombstone check in importer.go only prevents CREATION when tombstones exist in DB. But if applyDeletionsFromMerge hard-deletes the tombstones before import runs (because they're not in the merged result), the check doesn't help.\n\nPotential fixes:\n1. Make tombstones 'win' in the beads merge driver (internal/merge/merge.go)\n2. Don't hard-delete tombstones in applyDeletionsFromMerge if they're in the DB\n3. Export tombstones to a separate file that's not subject to merge\n\nGhost issues: bd-cb64c226.*, bd-cbed9619.*","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-17T06:01:03.564230Z","updated_at":"2025-12-17T06:35:01.340264Z","closed_at":"2025-12-17T06:35:01.340264Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}

Add optional parameter `full_details=false` to ready/list (would increase payload)\n2. Create separate tools: ready_minimal/list_minimal + ready_full/list_full\n3. Accept breaking change and document upgrade path (current approach)\n4.

Agent A created 4 new issues and exported to issues.jsonl (commit 99a9d58)\n2. Agent A closed an issue and exported again (commit 58b4613) - JSONL now has 4 epics\n3. Agent B had stale database (from before step 1)\n4. Agent B worked on unrelated issue and exported (commit 0609233)\n5. Agent B's export **overwrote issues.jsonl**, removing the 4 epics created by Agent A\n6. Required manual recovery by re-exporting from Agent A's correct database\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n`bd export` should detect that the database is stale and either:\n- **Refuse to export** with error message explaining the issue\n- **Warn prominently** and require explicit --force flag to override\n- **Auto-import first** to sync database before exporting\n\n## How to Detect Staleness\n\nCompare modification times (similar to VC's ValidateDatabaseFreshness):\n1. Check .db, .db-wal, .db-shm timestamps (use newest for WAL mode)\n2. Check issues.jsonl timestamp\n3. If JSONL is newer by >1 second: database is stale\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nAdd staleness check in `bd export`:\n\n```go\nfunc Export(dbPath, jsonlPath string, force bool) error {\n    // Check if database is stale\n    if !force {\n        if err := checkDatabaseFreshness(dbPath, jsonlPath); err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"database is stale: %w\\n\" +\n                \"Run 'bd import %s' first to sync, or use --force to override\",\n                err, jsonlPath)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Proceed with export...\n}\n```\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Severity**: High (silent data loss)\n- **Frequency**: Happens in multi-agent workflows when agents don't sync\n- **Workaround**: Manual recovery (re-export from correct database)\n\n## References\n\n- VC issue tracker: commits 58b4613 -> 0609233 -> c41c638\n- VC has similar check: `storage.ValidateDatabaseFreshness()`\n- Tolerance: 1 second (handles filesystem timestamp precision)","design":"","acceptance_criteria":"","notes":"","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-08T03:39:24.172154Z","updated_at":"2025-11-08T04:05:13.649736Z","closed_at":"2025-11-08T03:58:43.300177Z","sender":"","ephemeral":false,"replies_to":"","duplicate_of":"","superseded_by":"","deleted_by":"","delete_reason":"","original_type":""}
